# Smart_Calendar_Assistant
An add-on in Google Calendar with multiple functions.

I created an add-on for Google Calendar called Smart Calendar Assistant by writing code in Google Apps Script. It has multiple functions: tag, priority, flexibility, and event color. I also developed an AI-powered function: Smart Break Suggestions. Smart Break Suggestions can generate suggestions for the time slot between two user-created events to improve users' time management.
